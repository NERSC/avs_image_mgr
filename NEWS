 * Loop-mounted ext4 filesystems are now used for image and addon
   builds.

   backend (by setting IMAGE_BACKEND=rinse).
 * Separate logs are now kept from each addon and image build step.
 * Verbosity to stdout is greatly decreased.
 * All environment variables except PATH and TERM are now dropped
   during avs_image_mgr startup
 * Fixed a bug in the xCAT addon generation script which could cause
   image builds to hang indefinitely during certificate generation.
 * In EL images, all services are disabled by default.
 * Numerous code cleanups and error handling improvements.  An attempt
   is now made to print out the full environment and  grep out the
   lines being executed in each frame.
 * Add quick start guide.

avs_image_mgr 0.12.5                 2014-10-03
======================================
 * Prune locales after every yum invocation.
   This should prevent subsequent package installations
   from placing unwanted locales in the image.

avs_image_mgr 0.12.4                 2014-09-29
======================================
 * Immediately upgrade all packages after YUM repos have been

   triggering problems later in the build.

======================================

   through the OFED_RPMS environment variable

   the empty string
